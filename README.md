# 📌 Data Mapping Assumptions

JSONPlaceholder does not provide dedicated fields for:

* First Name
* Last Name
* Department

To satisfy the assignment requirements:

* The full `name` field is split into **First Name** and **Last Name**.
* A default department is assigned during data mapping.
* CRUD operations are maintained on the client side because JSONPlaceholder does not persist changes.

---

# ✅ Form Validation

The application validates:

* First Name
* Last Name
* Email
* Department

Validation includes:

* Required fields
* Email format validation

---

# 📱 Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive.

### Desktop

* Responsive data table
* Pagination controls

### Tablet

* Adaptive layout
* Flexible search controls

### Mobile

* Mobile user cards
* Touch-friendly controls
* Responsive dialogs

---

# ⚠️ Error Handling

The application gracefully handles:

* API failures
* Network issues
* Invalid form inputs
* Empty search results

Dedicated UI components are displayed instead of application crashes.

---

# 🔄 CRUD Operations

Since JSONPlaceholder is a fake REST API:

* POST requests simulate user creation.
* PUT requests simulate updates.
* DELETE requests simulate deletions.

The UI updates local application state immediately to provide a realistic user experience.
